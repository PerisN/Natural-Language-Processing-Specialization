# Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization

This repository is dedicated to the NLP specialization I am currently undertaking on Coursera. Through this specialization, I will learn how to design powerful NLP applications that encompass various tasks such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and even chatbot development. These applications are at the forefront of the ongoing shift towards an AI-driven future.
